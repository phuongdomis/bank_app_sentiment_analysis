Techcombank Mobile,the new app is horrible the interface is not user friendly at all i initially chose the fingerprints login option thinking if it fails the app at least would let me log in by other options like password or passcode but nope then when i turned off the fingerprints option so as to deliberately log in with password cuz i need it to make e payment i also could not,1,1,0
Techcombank Mobile,first the new user interface is a brave move by tcb team it appears sleek modern and geared toward year old however i would say the flow is not user friendly example transfer money should be compact in screen i personally feel uncomfortable to move different screens second im disappointed the new app does not come with many new features still very basic banking functions development team should look at bidv smartbanking mb app for reference i expect more from tcb app,2,1,0
Techcombank Mobile,ux ui is very unfriendly and not as fast as fast mobile since it takes too many unecessary screen changing i want everything to be shown on screen like the old one you have to think about people who is over are they not your target customers so you don't care if they cannot approach this ux ui,1,1,0
Techcombank Mobile,love the app it's similar to the banking app i have in australia which is very useful and easy to navigate around some old users might find it complicated but once you are used to the app it's so easy to use much better than the f st mobile one also plus point for the design two hearts,5,1,1
Techcombank Mobile,techcombank has fixed all the problems i mentioned before so i will change to stars thanks for actually reading and improving btw sometimes i can't transfer money on the app cos it says no internet connection but i check all the other apps are perfectly fine so i hope you will fix this too i think it's just a bug,5,1,1

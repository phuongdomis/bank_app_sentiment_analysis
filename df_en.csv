HDBank,Stupid bank app without help on how to generate otp. And the bank itself in Daklak is super slow. No number offer to customers and wait like 1h cannot enter the counter,1,1
HDBank,"High fees. And money sometimes just disappear from the account, without any explanation.",1,1
HDBank,"Unable to login by password and unable to login by fingerprint. It says account doesn't exist. So I tried internet banking in browser and it says your account is locked due to 3 failure attempts. ""HELP"" and chat function isn't working in app, says ""This service hasn't started yet"" Update: I've updated the recent app and many THANKS to the customer care. They have updated my new password and the account is working smoothly. Very fast !!",4,1
HDBank,"Whenever I choose transfer money option, the app stopped immediately. I don't know reason why.",3,1
HDBank,I can not run this app recently. It crashes all the times,3,1
HDBank,"Can login the internet banking using laptop, but could not login the app using mobile phone hdbank app",1,1

Techcombank Mobile,"This application is performing really bad, have to say this, after a countless number of times that I first tried to access the login screen with absolutely no responses. The worst experience among my mobile bankings ever.",1,1
Techcombank Mobile,"The new app is horrible; the interface is not user-friendly at all. I initially chose the fingerprints login option, thinking if it fails the app at least would let me log in by other options like password or passcode but nope. Then, when I turned off the fingerprints option so as to deliberately log in with password cuz I need it to make e-payment, I also could not.",1,1
Techcombank Mobile,"First, the new user interface is a brave move by TCB team. It appears sleek, modern and geared toward <30 year old. However, I would say the flow is not user friendly. Example: transfer money should be compact in 1 screen. I personally feel uncomfortable to move different screens. Second, Im disappointed the new app does not come with many new features. Still very basic banking functions. Development team should look at BIDV SmartBanking & MB app for reference. I expect more from TCB app.",2,1
Techcombank Mobile,Ux/ui is very unfriendly and not as fast as fast mobile since it takes too many unecessary screen changing. I want everything to be shown on screen like the old one. You have to think about people who is over 45. Are they NOT your target customers so you don't care if they cannot approach this ux ui?,1,1
Techcombank Mobile,"Love the app. It's similar to the banking app I have in Australia, which is very useful and easy to navigate around. Some old users might find it complicated but once you are used to the app, it's so easy to use. Much better than the F@st Mobile one. Also, plus point for the design 💕",5,1
Techcombank Mobile,"Techcombank has fixed all the problems I mentioned before so I will change to 5 stars. Thanks for actually reading and improving. Btw sometimes I can't transfer money on the app cos it says no internet connection, but I check all the other apps are perfectly fine. So I hope you will fix this too, I think it's just a bug.",5,1
Techcombank Mobile,"Worst UI ever, functions details are not separated and so confused. The only reason i gave 2 stars is because the app is smoother than the previous",2,1
Techcombank Mobile,"Cannot log in since few days. App is loading, loading, loadin............. forever. Customer service is also checking ... Forever. It's terrible app and dev teams.",1,1
Techcombank Mobile,The new interface is very difficult to use and not user-friendly as the old version (F@st mobile). The information is shown in a very big size which I had to scroll up and down to read. All necessary functions are hard to navigate.,1,1
Techcombank Mobile,"Please let me back to F@st mobile. When converted to new application, they took me a lot of time to make a transaction. System administrator, if needed, I can be a technical support to help you.",1,1
Techcombank Mobile,I don't mind to learn for get use with new UX. But I cannot accept the fact that new app take really longggggg time to load everything. It takes 15++ minutes to only loading my balance for transferring my cash.,1,1
Techcombank Mobile,"A lot of UI UX to improve to help customer in their journey. currently too much thinking. ""Don't make me think"".",4,1
Techcombank Mobile,"1. the location to display full Amount changed is difficult to find. need be improve. 1. the notification of Amount changed is delayed serveral or long time, this is a risk when owners dont know their amount withdraw unexpected immediately.",3,1
Techcombank Mobile,"Compare with previous app F@stConnect, the new app is more difficulty to use, and the features are also be reduced also. Even account by mobile number from outside-bank transfer also is disabled",1,1
Techcombank Mobile,This app is still an improvement. There are a lot of things need to be developed. I request this app has a function that delete or modify the contact list of receiver's account.,3,1
Techcombank Mobile,"Cannot log into the new app, have to use the web version. Please fix or allow us to use the good old Fast Access app instead.",1,1
Techcombank Mobile,"First they asked me to use this app instead of the old FastMobile since they were going to shut it down soon . After setting up my new password for this app, I couldn't even log in and they even locked my internet banking account. How frustrating!",1,1
Techcombank Mobile,"Before, I must log in with password with 8 characters and use passcode to verify transaction. Now, the user only needs input 4 numbers to log in your account, then they can do transaction. It's mean when you left your mobile in a while, anyone can use your account. It's very disapointed.",1,1
Techcombank Mobile,"1. Should include balance information under Accounts and cards transaction > transaction history. Why put Balance notifications in a separate portal, hidden in Notifications? 2. Let user customize the text for money transfer 3. User should be able to hide their balance everywhere including transfer money portal Understand there are a lot to work on still but hopefully it can be done soon",3,1
Techcombank Mobile,working faster & it's really easy to use. Better than the previous version.,5,1
Techcombank Mobile,Quite good. Can't find the balance notification to track transactions.,4,1
Techcombank Mobile,Terrible app for a bank as it can only check balance... nothing else is works((( Its a pity that a bank with name TECH have such kind of apps(,1,1
Techcombank Mobile,"Can I use the old app? This new app is unfriendly, App interface is more difficult than the old version.",2,1
Techcombank Mobile,Modern and friendly UI/UX. Good job with re-designing the app. Major step up from the old outdated one. Few features needed asap: - edit contact list - set up recurring payments - show current balance next to each transaction - dark mode,4,1
Techcombank Mobile,"Well, understand why so many 1* here. I've created new pw via Fast mobile follow instructions and logged in via new app but then it said incorrect user and pw. Then I've come back the Fast mobile and re-done every step but same issue. Don't know how to do next. Need further improvement before shutdown the old app. Nam A bank has provided 2 different apps for different users. Thanks.",1,1
Techcombank Mobile,"- The app's feedback option is extremely hard to write. Instead of staying above the keyboard, it hid under it. I couldn't see what I have typed and had to fix many times. - Automatically log out when I have not done writing feedback. So I have to write here. - I couldn't pay my flight tickets via techcombank visa card. I have called them many times and they have guaranteed me the card is fine, which it wasn't. I had to pay with my other card. - The staffs who I called wasn't very helpful.",1,1
Techcombank Mobile,"- After moved from the old app, it slowly loads the feature. I need to wait 2 days to see credit card management section. - Anyway, the UI is clean and better.",4,1
Techcombank Mobile,UI is not good. The notification doesn't display for each transitions. It must be logged into the app to see the changes,1,1
Techcombank Mobile,"Really bad n sad for VN's (still) largest consumer bank. Amazingly, the first 1* have been there as far back as Oct 2021 n the problem apparently still persists as I have just been requested to migrate to the new version today (Mar 19th 2022). And of course it doesn't work. Now neither versions work for me. My wife is lucky she is still on older version, for some reasons. So why me??? The web version too is on strike 🤬. Hope other TCB's shareholders would read these reviews... I did.",1,1
Techcombank Mobile,It's difficult to use as the contents are too complicated and interface is so poor. Please bring the clients back to old app.,1,1
Techcombank Mobile,The upgraded version is super horrible . Send us back to the old one,1,1
Techcombank Mobile,Better than I thought. However the design should be simpler and more straight-forward.,4,1
Techcombank Mobile,"added more options and functionality, easy to use. love this new app!",5,1
Techcombank Mobile,"Forced change from Fast Connect to this app, but can't login",1,1
Techcombank Mobile,"Transfer didn't go through, and I have no idea whether it is either on-going/success/failed",2,1
Techcombank Mobile,modern design but it needs to faster and smoother,4,1
Techcombank Mobile,How can i delete beneficiary from list of beneficiaries? It seems that the app has not allowed to do it.,3,1
Techcombank Mobile,I cant tell why they switch to this app. No more new interesting feature. And the UI/UX is.... 100% awful!!! The old version was much more easier to use. They messed up everything,1,1
Techcombank Mobile,Impossible to login even if inputting account correctly.,1,1
Techcombank Mobile,Cannot log in even set up in Fast Mobile,1,1
Techcombank Mobile,I've been using fast@mobile for years now. Now fast@mobile forced me to switch to this. It ask me to make a new pw and ID for this app but i couldn't login via new pw. When i logged using my old pw it said that my online account was locked??? Better than that they doesn't provide any reason why my online account was locked? Now both apps are useless how do i transfer money? Honestly horrible experience Edit: after a day the old app give me another chance to update pw. After that all is good.,4,1
Techcombank Mobile,"Worst app ever. I have an emergency situation but can not transfer money. Since i downloaded this app, i tried about 20 times to transfer money but it didn't work. Horrible experience!",1,1
Techcombank Mobile,"Techcombank Call center explains that Smart OTP is useless, thus this new mobile app does not request any OTP for transaction. Only 4 digit passcode, you can do everything from log in to transaction. Such a disappointed app!",1,1
Techcombank Mobile,Boring app. Take too long to finish a transfer vs old app. Not much useful and convenient vs old app. 1 positive point is modern ui but cannot help for poor ux.,1,1
Techcombank Mobile,"Required me to create a new password from the old app. When I login to the new app it said ""Incorrect"". Now I can't login both. Edit: Took me an hour and the new app suddenly let me login.",3,1
Techcombank Mobile,A little uncomfortable when I use it. I set a password but login by validate number (OTP number). What does my password use for? Please fix it like the older app!,3,1
Techcombank Mobile,Why not showing account balance by every transaction. I have to manually calculated in my head the balance after each single transaction. Isn't bank app supposed to do so?,1,1
Techcombank Mobile,"simple, easy to use, attractive design",4,1
Techcombank Mobile,"Very fast, secure and completely free.",5,1
Techcombank Mobile,"The new app looks nice, I guess that you guys are trying to mimic the commonwealth bank look, modern, simple. The app however is still unfinished, there are still lot of bugs, sometimes you can't log in or system error. The transfer delay is too long compare to the previous app i.e F@st Mobile. With F@st its the transfer time is almost instant, with this app you need at a day or two just to get the transfer through.",3,1
Techcombank Mobile,"pretty great app, easy to use and nice to look at",5,1
Techcombank Mobile,The app crashes all the time. It loads like forever whenever I need to take an action.,1,1
Techcombank Mobile,"UX and UI is not good for the user. Keyboard always appears. It makes user feel uncomfortable. Additional, Push notification to device have multi lines. In the new version, the notification only have one line, it's not enough information to see. When user want to see full notification, user open the app. It is not convenient.",2,1
Techcombank Mobile,It says my phone has been rooted even though this android can't be rooted. Suck,1,1
Techcombank Mobile,The interface not user-friendly,1,1
Techcombank Mobile,"Not even able to log in although I've created a new password in the old app. It constantly announces that the username or password is incorrect, but I can 100% sure that I've entered the correct ones for thousand times. It's really annoying!",1,1
Techcombank Mobile,"love the app, Techcombank doing great with the technology improvement",5,1
Techcombank Mobile,"The service of this bank is so bad, took 2 weeks and my small problem about ebanking system is not solved. Not recommend to use this bank.",1,1
Techcombank Mobile,Too bad. Can't open and login,1,1
Techcombank Mobile,View UI/UX and function on Fast Mobile is good. But New App no want to use,1,1
Techcombank Mobile,Where is otp on this app. Forced me to switch to an app that isn't completed yet. Now I have to reinstall fast mobile again,3,1
Techcombank Mobile,The login button not react when i tap on it.,1,1
Techcombank Mobile,"Not being able to login even though I had to change my pw multiple times. I am sure I have entered correct pw and username or else the app would inform ""incorrect password or username"". And if I press ""forgot username"" it redirects me to change my password. What a non-sense! You made us switch to this app too early, and stopped us from the old app before this new one is ready. First time totally disappointed with TCB.",1,1
Techcombank Mobile,"The red theme is so annoying, once loaded up it hit my eyes with this super red hot screen, why hurting customers eyes like that?",2,1
Techcombank Mobile,"good service, easy to use UX",5,1
Techcombank Mobile,"Better than VCB app. If you use TCBS, this app is pretty useful as it integrates with TCBS and shows all your cash flow. 5/5.",5,1
Techcombank Mobile,App are slow during log in session.,4,1
Techcombank Mobile,"Looks nicer than F@st mobile and the name tailors the bank name now. There's still a minor bug issue where confirming allow in-app balance notification after installation goes on forever, restarting the app fixes it. Another issue might be the start animation, motion sick users can find it uncomfortable. Just a simple fade transition is professional enough. Also please, implement dark mode.",4,1
Techcombank Mobile,"good app, highspeed but need more security",4,1
Techcombank Mobile,"I love the new UI. Clean n more friendly. Need more using to tell the UX but i'm having positive feeling abt it. Well done, TCB team",5,1

Techcombank Mobile,Does not work smoothly like Fast@mobile. Often receive loading issues,1,1
Techcombank Mobile,They detect a phone as jailbroken if developer mode is turned on. Are you kidding! 3rd class app.,1,1
Techcombank Mobile,Does not operate properly on Galaxy S20+: it simply doesn't start. 1 star.,1,1
Techcombank Mobile,This software sucks. Suddenly I cannot do anything on my app. Went to the bank and nobody there knows what to do.,1,1
Techcombank Mobile,Can you remove the feature in the old app which forces users to update to this unusable one???,1,1
Techcombank Mobile,The ui is very unfriendly,1,1
Techcombank Mobile,"The new app so ridiculous, it's deterioration. I can't hide the balance and all my transactions always show on main screen.",2,1
Techcombank Mobile,The app is super crash. I couldn't creat an online account. It kept telling me that something is wrong when I tried to take pictures of my ID. I tried a lot of time but it all failed.,1,1
Techcombank Mobile,"1. Lack information transactions such as date of transactions and some names of receivers or transmitters 2. Ask user to set password and passcode but the app set default log in by using passcode, cannot change the password mode 3. I cannot find where to change OTP 4. Should have a user manual to instruct customer first before applying the app in real life",2,1
Techcombank Mobile,"Please do test your application carefully before mass roll out to the market. Too many bugs, service interruption frequently. Cannot understand why you can release such poor quality product to the market. It is obviously unmatched to the name of Techcombank.",1,1
Techcombank Mobile,"An unfinished application, how lame it is when you switch to this , you neither use the previous version nor login on web browser which have more funtions than this ver (where is the freaking benefical management)",1,1

Techcombank Mobile,"This is a nightmare, I can't make any transactions. Can't even log in, I tried and failed to log in 99 out of 100 times. Can't even imagine this is an iBanking application. I called Support Center and was told it was because of my internet connection, how irresponsible!",1,1
Techcombank Mobile,Great experience. I enjoy how easy it is to search for a saved recipient and I no longer have to choose from so many transfer options.,5,1
Techcombank Mobile,"After only 2 days with the new app, I must say it is much more better than the older version. From the UI, the categories, the way you transfer money, it's really easy to use. Good job techcom team!",5,1
Techcombank Mobile,"After logined in my account via typing username and password, this app still asked me to input OTP code. Now I'm in abroad and my Vietnam sim card doesn't work. That is why I rate for this app 1 star. Definitely.",1,1
Techcombank Mobile,"The worst e-banking app ever! Cannot log in though the internet connection or the password is very ok, right. I do not want to use this fvckjng app but the f@st mobile app cannot be used",1,1
Techcombank Mobile,"I've tried to log in but fail anytime, it make me feel so uncomfortable. I need to make some transactions but i don't have time to go to the bank or ATM so what can I do now when this app and the old app are off either?",1,1
Techcombank Mobile,So bad. UI/UX is too difficult to use. Notification function doesn't work. Why I have to migrate to new app when it not finish???,1,1
Techcombank Mobile,This app keeps saying something went wrong at different times and steps though my connection is strong and the info is correct.,1,1
Techcombank Mobile,Rolling out this new piece of garbage and forcing users to switch is not a smart move at all. I went through all kind of trouble for not being able to transfer money today. I'm switching to another bank. Bye.,1,1

Techcombank Mobile,"F***king stupid! I dowload it and can't sign in even try to delete and download and download again and again over 1000 times. So now my account JUST ONLY USE BY CARD, THIS APP IS NOT WORKING? Please Techcombank, tell me how to continue work with you? Or I've to cancel everything in your bank and never comeback?",1,1
Techcombank Mobile,How long you update my password cant even login. Edited: Good for now!,5,1
Techcombank Mobile,The new interface is not convenient,1,1
Techcombank Mobile,"Great design. Smooth. Quick transfer. UX is quite complicated at first time but will be very confortable after 2,3 time used. I love the QR payment",5,1
Techcombank Mobile,"If any member of the dev team can read this, please know that your app is terrible and we want YOU to fix it. Or just let me get back to F@st mobile.",1,1

Techcombank Mobile,"it said no internet connection meanwhile at this time, while im writing this review the wifi is still full and strong. what th was that 😒",1,1
Techcombank Mobile,Techcombank really doesn't pay attention to their customers' experience? This is the first time I know it be this irrational to force us to get into frustration. I didn't make the change but I never want to do so as being bombarded by 1* reviews.,1,1
Techcombank Mobile,Very slow loading,2,1
Techcombank Mobile,"I can't use this version or the old version. Fa@t mobile prevents my access because of the release of Techcombank mobile, which even not working.",1,1

F@st Mobile,"After the update to Android 12 for my Samsung Note 10+, I could not sign in using my Fingerprint recognition. I have to say it causes me a great deal of inconvenience (since Im living abroad and seeking support from Call Centre is challenging). As i see some reviews describing the same problem, I wish that the provider will update and improve the fingerprint recognition as soon as possible. Thank you.",3,1
F@st Mobile,"Constantly crash after the update for OTP This is the second time the app crashes, proventing me to open it. I tried uninstall the app the first time but when I get to log on, I had to set up the OTP numbers again. It's not difficult but sure is time consuming. You use an app so everything can be quick and within your capabilities so what's the point? The app itself was good but there is this problem with only a few users. I hope they fix it soon",2,1
F@st Mobile,"Sometimes when I can't log in, I'm shown the message ""Invalid username or password"" and I have to wait a long time before I can log in again. I think if the server is in error please send the message ""Server error"" because If people don't know, they will change the password.",1,1
F@st Mobile,"App show error message when I try to login with fingerprint. I use it normally before upgrade OS version. Others app work well with fingerprint feature, so this is a OS compability issue of this app.",3,1
F@st Mobile,"Fingerprint login has been broken for over a month, throwing the error: ""Key [fingerprintpw] not found. System is maintaining. Please try later. (Code: 101022)""",2,1
F@st Mobile,"Well, for those who experience error with fingerprint, the solution is to deactive your smart OTP, then uninstall Fast Mobile app, reinstall app and reset everything, including smart OTP and fingerprint",4,1
F@st Mobile,"I cannot close the ""update to new app"" advertisement. Is it some kind of on purpose feature or is just a bug? Please fix this asap cause the new app is extremely terrible",1,1
F@st Mobile,"Such a terrible service and app. I tried to change my password to login for first time but it was unable to do that. I called to hotline to hear what i read on website, no extra support or something like that. They asked me go to office to get password reset. Ok, so I went to office to listen the same as hotline service. They acted like i did something wrong not their app. Finally, there is some issue with my account in system. Thank you so much for a kind support. I terminated my bank account",1,1
F@st Mobile,"Recently I could not access through fingerprint, tried to change the rule but there was error code 101019. Pls fix it.",3,1
F@st Mobile,"So far so good.... however, after my phone (Galaxy note 10) got Android 12 updatation ... finger print log in no longer works, seem like the directory for finger print preferences have been changed.... Please look into this issue cuz it is giving me some inconvinient moments. I have dowloaded the ""Techcombank app"" but that app havent move my account to its system just yet so I am still having to use this one ...",4,1
F@st Mobile,"I can't use napas 24/7 transaction anymore. I input receiver's bank, acct. no., but nothing happen.",2,1
F@st Mobile,I cannot use fingerprint on Samsung Note 10 after the OS upgrade. It's not compatible with my device (android 12).,4,1
F@st Mobile,"I can not log in to my account. The app keeps saying that my username or password is incorrect, but I'm sure I enter the correct information. This is blocking me from doing any transactions. Please take an action! I'm seeing the same situations from other reviews posted since November and I'm worried about how long it will take to fix this issue.",3,1
F@st Mobile,it's good so far. I think smart OTP is a very convenient and safe way to transfer the money. Imagine that when you lose your phone and in the worst sence someone can log in to your account and use the OTP through SMS 😱 thanks the team. Keep up the good work!,5,1
F@st Mobile,"Dont know what's going on in this App. Keep telling that my password was not correct when I used the correct one multiple times. Tried to change password, but no matter how many options I used, always notification on unacceptable was popped out. What's a disappointment!",1,1
F@st Mobile,"Easy to use. One minus star is due to the credit card paying display. After paying off (full payment), it still shows the same amount before doing so. As a result, it could make me people confused.",4,1
F@st Mobile,"Very disappointing. Password limits the maximum number of characters. Requires frequent password changes. Changing my password often makes it impossible for me to remember which one I am using. When resetting the password, the server doesn't send the confirmation code. The data load was very slow, often blaming my poor connection (even though I used 4g and fiber). The customer service department couldn't do anything but pointlessly extend the waiting time.",1,1
F@st Mobile,"After updating , i cant make any transactions via app , especially credit card ( Visa ) eventhough my balance is still valid. I did the transactions but i didnt get any OTP messages which is sent to the owner's phone registration. That was so annoying. Hope the mistakes will be handled as soon as possible",2,1
F@st Mobile,"i can't do anything with this app since i can't even login when i have already reinstalled and tried to log in at many places which has strong wifi and i even use my data but the system still announces that the internet is too slow or too much people are using. If"" too much people are using "" means at 3 AM in the morning all citizens of this city transact only by this app then make sense . I hope that the company can fix this bug and this app , i hope this will not occur again",1,1
F@st Mobile,"The app is hard to use, new update suck me at otp, error, very very very bad app, do not use this bank",1,1
F@st Mobile,"I hope you read this review. Everything is great until I used my new credit card, swiped 3 times but there's no update in the credit balance and no transactions shown in the app (even tho the SMS does update). Tried to update the app but no use.. what's your business flow for this? I asked the banker and she told me it would be updated in the next day but it's been 2 days already? Can you try to adjust my balance manually or a cronjob maybe can help? Thanks!",3,1
F@st Mobile,"Given that I use my fingerprint to login the requirement to change the password so often is rather ridiculous. Otherwise, it's a useful and generally user-friendly app.",4,1
F@st Mobile,"System bug - OTP generator. After entering SmartOTP code, it never appear generated OTP code, neither the number of seconds, until the session expires. I cannot transfer anything. Please fix it! My sister in vietnam can use normally but I'm abroad and it doesn't work. Why?",1,1

F@st Mobile,"I was update version. I can not see otp or setup smart otp for transfer money. But I talk about with contact center and her talk with me pls: remove app and reinstall from store. Before update need remove smart otp. Bla..bla..bla.. I don't understand why upgrade? Customer don't need install and reinstall for app. Why smartphone have biometrics always need remember password sign-in this app. I dis like FastMobile, team tech of TCB need learning deploy product, customer service need learning SLA.",1,1
F@st Mobile,"Why password with more than 8 charaters not allow?! This is banking and finance businesses, the password is supposed to be as flexible and complex as possible",1,1

F@st Mobile,So annouying. I couldn't take any transactions today even I already updated to the latest version. I even couldn't jump in the home page of the app.,1,1
F@st Mobile,"For a few years it was good, but now - terrible: - Constantly going down - for days - Sometimes international transfers are just sent back for no reason - ATM cards originally to be canx for foreigners in march but thats been put back to this mth, May 2020 - Clever timing given the pandemic. Cardless transfer stuck in ""Pending"" for 48hrs. Reason, input amount states they accept 50'000 dong but tried 11 + atms and because they dont stock you would think you could cancel it but cancelling renders error code and to contact Techombank, which I did and they stated it would take 3 to 6 days to resolve and cant be done through telephone banking. - Note - you can change your password by one digit - which isnt reassuring. Clearly the very wealthy who run this bank are cowboys scrimping. Shoddy - find another bank.",1,1
F@st Mobile,There is no option to hide info of notification. It show total money I have on new transaction. I will not happy if my friend use my phone.,1,1

F@st Mobile,"Buggy as hell. Reset password and can not login with the new password; reset again, and still can not login. Many times, can not transfer money to other bank account because ""Thực hiện"" button is disabled",1,1
F@st Mobile,"Name is fast mobile but can not loging, slow connection, stupid in management. Compare to other bank applications this is like garbage. Please use another bank account with another mobile app. Techcombank is one of the worst ones you could use.",1,1
F@st Mobile,"The features are fine, but it would be better if you re-design your UI and UX.",4,1
F@st Mobile,I cannot access to this app every night. That's really a point. They allow transfer money 24/24 but how can do if we cannot access to it? And if I need to lock my card urgently? So bad,1,1
Techcombank Business,Too terrible. I can't transfer money. And now I also can't log in,1,1
Vietcombank,"I open an eCard with the app. However, it is not usable.",1,1
Vietcombank,"I never see a supercharge using a debit card like Vietcombank, yesterday I have bought a flight ticket around 699 USD the bank charged me 39 USD.!!!! then I bought another ticket and charged me 32USD.OMG I will change fast this ridicules bank",1,1
Vietcombank,"Terrible customer service. In this digital age, everything is done online and makes it easy for customer to use the app and services. However, VCB makes it extremely difficult for customer. I forgot the password to login the app a few weeks ago and such VCB blocked my account completely. The only way I can do to unblock it is to come to a VCB store and provide request documents??? Why? Digital bank but there is no other way for customer to get back their blocked account on digital environment???",1,1
Vietcombank,Easy to use and good visualization!,5,1
Vietcombank,"The new update try to look pro but fail to do so. Constantly crash on Android 8.0.0, Samsung Experience 9, Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge.

Vietcombank,"The first version of app ran very well but the latest one is horrendous. Indeed, transaction was lag and dropped off every time when I tried to make one. Back to the old school version, simple but efficient. New version, elegant color but annoying and useless.",1,1
Vietcombank,"App is easy to use. UI is professional and beautiful. Main color of app is green and black that makes me feel comfortable. I can select various themes. UX is nice and great. All functions work well. Performance is good. App lauches fast. All functions response right after I tap. I voted 5 stars so that I would like to encourage design, development and test teams.",5,1
Vietcombank,"After the last update I didn't recieve any notifications about account change. And the craziest thing is when I open the app, I can see all those notifications even BEFORE logging in, as if there is no security there. Also, I don't like the new appearance. Please fix it!",1,1
Vietcombank,"Just an overwhelming amount of fees for every little thing. The app sucks, it now require you to fill out the name of the person you're transfering money to instead of just give you the name when you put in their bank number, which is so stupid and for no reason at all, makes it more prone to you sending money to the wrong people. The service also sucks and people are incompetent.",1,1
Vietcombank,"This app caused so much confusion and blocked users from experiencing smoothly. Just re-install the app yet it said my mobile phone has been blocked (not mentioning the reason) while I still can use internet banking and pay monthly countless fee. Also, hotline is such a mess, causing iritation for customer with unclear messages and can never be reachable.",1,1
Vietcombank,"Ugly and confused UI. Half of the app is ads and useless ""features.""",1,1
Vietcombank,The app itself is quite full of services and it used to work perfectly. Since the last update it opens for few seconds and the it collapses. Hope they can fix it. I run it on a Huawei P10lite,1,1
Vietcombank,"Hello, sorry for 2 stars. It'll great if you increase the time of ""transaction history"" . Why it's only 1 week and 1 month ? I can check the history if it only show one month. I have many accounts which different term 1, 3, 6, 12 months . Please update the time to at least 12 months. Thank a lot.",2,1
Vietcombank,Stop updating without notification in advance. The fingerprint was invalid when the bank updated or added any functions. Bad application. I hate using this app. Please allow us acessing on the website instead of using this stupid digital app before the bank develop and fix all the errors completely. Thanks.,1,1
Vietcombank,"I have an account & I've registered my phone number. They've been sending me notification messages ever since. And yet when I logged in, I couldn't do so with my phone number. Impeccable app design. Gonna stick to web app from now on.",1,1
Vietcombank,Cant use the fringer print. Inconvenient than old previous. Please fix it.,3,1
Vietcombank,"Whoever designed this app has to be sent back to UX UI school: green letters on a transparent background? One third of the screen filled with advertising? A cluttered interface with 263 functions? Come on! Banking functionality is good, the rest is terrible, sorry. Contact me to discuss in detail, this is 1993 of banking 0.9.",1,1
Vietcombank,"This is execllent banking app. Easy to use. Of course, when you first time sign up you need to fill up all your personal information to match your bank details. After, is fast and easy to do the thing you need, transfer settle, pay bill... Love you vcb app",5,1
Vietcombank,"I got trouble with digital banking, i typed right password of mobile banking but can register digital banking. It always says that i typed wrong password and lock.

If you cant fix this misstake by the fast, please remove this app down the store. It's really terrible.",1,1
Vietcombank,"Good app. Many functions, easy to use, convenient for trading. Easy to access with fingerprints. I voted 5 stars so that i would like encourage design, development and test teams.",5,1
Vietcombank,"Terrible. Sending/receiving money often encounters issue and needs to roll back transaction. If you want to do business with it, it will waste your time and put you at risk. I need to do quick transaction but it hangs a big amount of money in the air. The support is hopeless and all you can do is to wait for a long time.",1,1
Vietcombank,"The app always stops working every time I open it, I cannot even log-in or do anything with the app. It has happened since the app updated to Digibank version",1,1

Vietcombank,"After I updated the new version, I had to register my fingerprint and smart otp from scratch. It's also annoying that when I am off and then turn back, I need to register my fingerprint and smart otp again 😏. The only noti I receive in that case is: ""System busy"" 😏",1,1
Vietcombank,"So bad. 1st, UX screen not be friendly. Spent more time to migrate usage from ibanking. 2nd, login ID is being phone number which is easy to hack from backdoor or anyone knowns 3rd, some error has been being throw with maybe java exception. Final, every time for forgetting pwd must be go to the nearest banking transaction office to sumbit request unlock account. That's terrible!!!",1,1
Vietcombank,"While I'd give the app 4 out of 5 stars, Vietcombank itself deserves 0 out of 5 stars. Card payments frequently fail, and ATM withdrawals have about a 60% success rate at Vietcombank's own ATM's. The worst part is if you try to withdraw at a different ATM, your account may get debited EVEN IF THE WITHDRAWAL FAILED. This has happened to me twice now. The first time Vietcombank reimbursed me but the second time they did not. Vietcombank is fraudulent garbage. Don't trust them with your money!",1,1

TPBank Mobile,Cannot register new account. This app does not work well at every steps...,1,1
TPBank Mobile,Too compilated to get the OTP code to activate etoken. Even the supporter also ask me uninstall the app and reinstall again. It us such a failure for a hi-tech bank. I will sell all TPB's share that I'm holding!,1,1

TPBank Mobile,"New UI/UX is good and performance is good as well than the old one. But in the new release, you have skipped the Transferring Samples feature. I could save a sample but couldn't load that to transfer the same account in the next time.",4,1
TPBank Mobile,"I cannot create any new saving since I updated to the latest version. And another annoying, the app ask me to access my contact list, I say no and app do not access the account list that I saved before. Why a banking app need to access my contact list?

And the notification list inside the app only shows recent ad, not the history of notification.",3,1
TPBank Mobile,- UI is bad like a web that is out of date (1*) - Transaction took so much time to finish and many times got timeout when instanctly transfer money inter-bank via ATM card (1*) - Touching action is not responsive like a touch to the wood.

VietinBank iPay,"Personally, I think the App is very bad. I can't log in to my account, even though the password and username are correct. The App notices ""You have the wrong username or password"" but: Firstly, I can still log into my account on Vietinbank's Website. Secondly, if I have the wrong password or username, the account will be locked but the app keep saying like above. Thirdly, my phone has no problem because I just changed my new phone, but I still can't log in. I need to your answer for this problem",1,1
VietinBank iPay,"Good app but it seems clients will be asked to set up again sometimes even after fingerprint has been registered. Also there is no warning that after 5 times of failure to log in, Ipay is locked and to unlock is very time consuming.

BIDV SmartBanking,"It doesn't work. And for fingerprint, then falls back to here (the play store)",1,1
BIDV SmartBanking,"The UI is better than the older versions. But it still takes too long to retrieve data from server to display to the app, I can enjoy my whole cup of coffee before seeing the transaction list from app and it sucks. One more thing, I could check my transaction list for a range of only 1 month, sometimes I want to get the report for the whole year instead.",4,1
BIDV SmartBanking,"This app is really inconvenient. For the past 4 months, I've had to uninstall and re-install it for 3-4 times because it does not send me the OTP.",2,1
BIDV SmartBanking,The app does not open with fingerprint and closes the app after that,1,1
BIDV SmartBanking,"This app is epic bro - I almost have no trouble in using this app. I went to one of the BIDV's banks for a Masterclass card, and it took only 5 days to receive a new one. This helped me keep up with Zhongli's banner and I got him in the last hours. Anyway, thanks again for your services!",5,1

BIDV SmartBanking,"I couldn't log in using other device, this app waste me so much time trying to register my id to turn that feature on (and it doesn't even work in the end). You guy also try to hide negative reviews. I planed to use bidv for my saving, but now look like it's time to look for other banks.",1,1
BIDV SmartBanking,"I'm a new customer. I went to the bank to register for the smart banking app they told foreigners cant use the app. If foreigners cant use the app how can i check my account balance, and make transfer. I haven't received sms about the deposit i made. I have enough money in my account but my MasterCard isn't working. I can't use it for anything. I'm planning to close my account.",1,1

BIDV SmartBanking,"""Foreigners are not allowed for internet banking"" I forgot my password and went to the branch to request new password but they denied. So I closed my account with BIDV. Very poor experience !!",1,1
BIDV SmartBanking,"Worst app ever. I literally don't want to rate this app any star (if possible) because this ""smart"" banking absolutely not worth it. I could never bank anyone any money because the otp mess never show up. Can't understand why this ""big"" bank can not afford to do what other banks can",1,1
BIDV SmartBanking,"The ott now so slow, not fast as the previous version",1,1
BIDV SmartBanking,"This app sucks. The OTP sms for a money transfer request just wont come. The app name even has ""smart"" and ""banking"" in it which show no use",1,1
BIDV SmartBanking,"It 's not smart banking. It must be stupid banking. Everytime i back to home page, it make me quit from this app. Very terrible experience.",1,1
BIDV SmartBanking,"Impressive work by VCB digital banking team! Many features, lean layout, easy flow. Keep up with the good work!",5,1
BIDV SmartBanking,"Do not use BIDV, try Techcom bank and VP bank, u'll have betrer service and faster process at the bank. BIDV thinks it's a good idea to update their system without intergrading or propper testing, lock people out and make people come in just to be able to access an account.",1,1

BIDV SmartBanking,It is still not working with the official Android 11 properly. Developers should have updated your app immediately.,2,1
BIDV SmartBanking,"This app won't even let me log in. Asked me to change my password, then add a pin and then change password again.",1,1
BIDV SmartBanking,Cannot change password once the existing password was expired. It keeps saying the request cannot be performed and asks to retry again later.,1,1
BIDV SmartBanking,"I forgot password, so i can not log in the app. And I do not receive any solutions from it to support me if the bank is so far away.",1,1
BIDV SmartBanking,"What happens with my app?🤔 It lag, I try it again 3 times. Uninstall and redownload. Not better😭😭😭",2,1
BIDV SmartBanking,It won't send me the OTP for transactional service. Can't recognize my fingerprint either.,1,1
BIDV SmartBanking,very good and useful. sometimes i can not make transaction but it was fixed immêdiatlly. very good,5,1

VPBank NEO,What's wrong with this app now? I've got 0 balance when I opened it 4 days ago and since then the apps stops working. I tried to redownload it just in case will work unfortunately it's the same. I wanted to see the money being forwarded in my account but I can't open my apps. Freaking bad!!!!,2,1
VPBank NEO,"Too bad, there s no 'transfer purpose' when making the transfer, you have to do it all again. There's no fingerprint also, no matter how many times I try to setup. Thrash",1,1
VPBank NEO,Please bring back screen capture function immediately. It helps a lot for my transaction confirmation.,5,1
VPBank NEO,The app keeps asking me to vote 5 stars. It is really annoying,1,1
VPBank NEO,Cannot enable login by short PIN.,1,1
VPBank NEO,the OTP code is alway unmatch and CAN NOT process the final stage: clarification of user,1,1
VPBank NEO,"The app is good. But, the overall customer experience is extremely annoying. Thousand of calls from the bank to sell other services that I've never signed up for. Rude telesalepeople. They ignored my wish not to receive those disturing call times after times. I had to block its number today.",1,1
VPBank NEO,"I have used VPB for such a long time. While using it, I realized the bank automatically reset login password and ATM card password without any notice or apology for 2-3 times/year. It also raised concerns employees of the bank can easily use customer accounts for other purposes. There has never been a bank that is bad, disrespecting its users and violently interfering with confidential information as it does. Does the state bank of Vietnam aware this unacceptable action?",1,1
VPBank NEO,"I opened the app 7 hours ago and it asked me to update. I updated then tried to log in, but the app would buffer for 3 minutes then go ""The system cannot connect. Try again?"" It's been doing that for 7 hours!!",1,1
VPBank NEO,Good experience. So fast and convenient!,5,1
VPBank NEO,Works fine now. Turns out it's the OS that messed everything up.,5,1
VPBank NEO,"The Neo version is really bad. I do not even know who transfer the money to my account in balance, even checking the information is hard on smartphone. Did the dev team really use this version before publish to the users @.@??? How can I check immediately the sender information if there is no function for that,orx I have to wait after 1 month to have new records in History?",1,1
VPBank NEO,The first time i use credit card at this bank. They are working as title of bank but the way they work very bad. They will call you at least 4 phone call each day as you are their debtor after they send statement and the deal date is not over. The worst bank which I have experienced to.,1,1
VPBank NEO,I already reported the login method's bug to you guys. Now both of Short PIN and Fingerfrint are not working at all in the latest version :) I have to use the password of my account to login this app. Quite disappointed :( Hope developers fix them as soon as possible.,4,1

VPBank NEO,Very good service: smooth and save,5,1
VPBank NEO,Easy to use fast money transfer,5,1
VPBank NEO,"App have big security bug in otp. Once you select send smart otp activation through email, you will never receive the email in time. At the same time, you lose your current otp method.

Dont delete this review, it is serious bug.",1,1

VPBank NEO,Good app! Fast and reliable,5,1
VPBank NEO,Cannot log in the app. Pls fix,1,1

VPBank NEO,"Stupid app, terrible app & wait very very long for response. When money come to your account must logout & login again to update the account balance. What a fool app!!! =))) Transaction history can only selected 01 day. Cannot select from date and to date.",1,1
VPBank NEO,It's stupid to require users to change the password every 1 or 2 months. This makes it actually less secure because many users cannot remember the new password and have to write it down somewhere.,1,1
VPBank NEO,"Stupid app. There's no settings to change language to English. Turned the fingerprint login on, but the app keeps forcing to login with password every time I reopen. ATM location takes hours to load.",1,1
VPBank NEO,"Overalls, this is a fine mobile banking app with a decent UI, functionality and security. For dev: the newest version crashes on Android 11. Update Oct 25: crash issue fixed",3,1
VPBank NEO,"Just got over 1000 notifications from this banking app. 1 second per promotion news, can you believe it? And when I tried to call their hotlines, their staff told me that it's OK, just a small bug dev. Still got lots of notifications till I deleted this app. Lol.",1,1

Agribank E-Mobile Banking,"The app is not applicable for foreigners who live in Vietnam to use because the application requires to register by taking photos of passport or ID card. But after several times of taking photos, the application is still not workable. It doesn't allow to pass as its AI mistakenly see my passport as a copy even I use the actual one. Why don't they do like the other banks that use only mobile number and OTP to approve the app register process which are clearly safety enough already.",1,1
Agribank E-Mobile Banking,"The worst app and bank so far. They never answer your call; they block any refund transactions; most of the time when u need to make a transaction, they app is under maintenance.

It is not unexpected to say the services are extremely bad although the fees are very high!",1,1
Agribank E-Mobile Banking,"The app has a BUG ! Not useful for foreigners living in Vietnam. Foreigners can't verify online. The AI- App ONLY accepts passport having *STAR shaped Red Stamp, Signature, Logo, Emblem same as VN passport. I've visited the bank and registered manually. Recently I've got a new smartphone and unable to verify online, even I know my login ID and password. The app doesn't accept registration. Due to lockdown I don't want to visit the branch at the moment.",1,1
Agribank E-Mobile Banking,"Whats the point when asking for fingerprint but giving no sensor on the screen, where can i even put my fingerprint ?",1,1

Agribank E-Mobile Banking,This app sucks and so does this bank,1,1
ACB One,Stupid app! The newest version is so trashy. Can't login by fingerprint although already set thousand times. Seem like tech team doesn't even bother working on client's feedbacks. Please check the bug and fix it soon or else your clients might want to change another bank for better service,1,1
ACB One,Back button seems not to be so responsive. And also please add quick login for face detection based phone,3,1
ACB One,"Login by fingerprint shows ""An error occured. Please try again"". Login sometimes works, sometimes does not. Already called the hotline but she said it all worked on her side. Nobody cares about customer experience. What a bad app app compared to their reputation.",1,1
ACB One,Useless history that cant even hold a year long worth of transaction .,2,1
ACB One,Overall okay now. There is no option to sell USD for VND so I have to use the Web version for it.,3,1
ACB One,"Lot of bugs, I still need to use the web app to do all my things. This app has all the functions, but it does not work. If I hit the execute button, it just stays there without any response. It happens everywhere, starting with the log in function. After entering my user and password, I press log in but nothing happens. I have to kill the app, open it again, do the same thing then I can log in.",2,1
ACB One,Can never log in with my fingerprint.,3,1
ACB One,"Good looking GUI but query time take so long (I used 4G as well as 6MBs FTTH wireless connection) on every feature.

ACB One,"Automatically extend the saving account of customer till 2021 with really low interest without informing customer, create difficulties to cancel it and force customer to take action for their system false. Dont know how many customers have such terrible experience. Will change to another bank right after all accounts expire......",1,1
ACB One,The app keeps auto disable fingerprints authentication after a period of time. Force me to reenter the password. It's too annoying. There is no other bank app does this.,1,1
ACB One,you guys need to work on the transactions. after each one there must be a balance showing how much money you have left after spending or withdrawing that amount of money. This problem causes too much confusing.,3,1
ACB One,"Functions : okay Portable : good Force update to use services : very terrible Most updates are minor fixes, or optimizations. those most likely won't affect the application. Yet force users to update, pls limit force update when there is a major update which affect the application or system itself",3,1
ACB One,It requires me to change password too properly. I feel annoyed when I have to create and remmember new symbol strings many times in a year.,1,1
ACB One,Doesn't allow to use the app. It said I have to update new version but my version is the latest one now and I cant update anymore The app was lagged and maintenance happened all the time which made me wait for hours although I need to use the money immediately,1,1
ACB One,"App require update. After updated, the screen update still appear and don't allow to use. Now stuck at update notification screen",2,1
ACB One,"Today I wanted to do remittance via app, the app asked me to Update app to new version. I Clicked on the Update button, but nothing to update in Play Store. :((",3,1

MyVIB,"Need to improve a lot. The app still have to much bug, not stable! Just used app to get OTP few days before. But now can't use and have to uninstall then reinstall after called the call center. Very,very inconvenience and uncomfortable The customer services also not to good. Should polite the customer and talking softer! Thanks!",1,1
MyVIB,"Updated: Thanks for quick response from support team. I will rate it 5 stars this time. ""MyVIB is not compatible with the current device"". My phone is Sky VEGA A910 with Android 7.1.2 installed. I know my phone and the OS were old, but the incompatibility is not acceptable. Please work on the issue asap. I will keep this rating until I can access my account via the app.",5,1
MyVIB,After updating my phone last week I get an error saying the app is not compatible. Contacting VIB support a week ago has not helped. Their service is terrible! They have not made any effort to communicate with me to resolve this issue. This is a huge problem as I cannot use OPT.,1,1
MyVIB,"Noob app, in-app photo taking self verification process is so useless that it won't check or warn you whether the image quality is good enough, wasting tons of time. Support service is even worse and slow to response. VIB staff are as incompetent as if it was their first day at work. Ambiguous instruction email, laggy server, online registration is a pain in the neck because of the always-ready-to-freeze-at-anytime servers.",1,1
MyVIB,"Downtime always. The fast transfer service always have issues while other banks rarely have that kind of issue. If there is a negative rating system, I will happy to give this bank and its app -5 star instead 1.",1,1

MyVIB,"In order to use Smart OTP you have to give this app ""Telephone"" permission, I don't see the relationship between generating OTP and telephone except this app want to spy on users.",1,1

MyVIB,This app was okay until the SmartOTP comes up and it freezes all the time...Not very smart as its name,1,1
MyVIB,I tried several times to register in the end I gave up because I can't get past the taking photo of my ID stage of the registration.,1,1
MyVIB,Lately app doesn't respond whicn means a trip to ATM except VIB remove many of their machines forcing use of other banks who wont always accept VIB debit cards...time for a new bank,2,1

F@st Mobile,Smart OTP is the worst thing Techcombank launched for their customers. I have many trouble with OTP and no staff supports me even I call their hotline. What's wrong with OTP and Techcombank service?!,1,1
F@st Mobile,very good user experience. I have been using techcombank for many years and their services are so good with nice client caring. thank you so much. keep on ur good work! ^^,5,1
F@st Mobile,"it was working super great on andorid P , but not compatible with Q anymore , it gets stuck after entering yhe smart OTP . please fix this soon .",3,1
F@st Mobile,"When u give Smart OTP, I cant transfer my money becaus my smartphone is rooted, I need to root my smartphone! Drop that feature and return the old one! or I change to use other bank!",1,1
F@st Mobile,"Terrible server, slow update data and please do not override back press listenner event if you cannot handle it.",1,1
F@st Mobile,"Recently got bugged. I cannot login using the same password and PIN that I used before. Please check this error, thank you.",3,1
F@st Mobile,"Couldn't login last night, instead show server error, it showed wrong password. Very frustrated.",2,1
F@st Mobile,The app should allow the user to generate an OTP even if he is already logged in. Now the OTP generation is only available at the login screen. The user has to log out first in order to use it.,4,1
F@st Mobile,Everything is fine and cool until they want me to change my password. Very unnecessary feature.,3,1
F@st Mobile,Fingerprint recognition failed after updating,1,1
F@st Mobile,"Due to ""Smart OTP"" which is ""not smart"" at all, now I cannot transfer any money anymore. You should change the way it works.",2,1
F@st Mobile,Great customer service and employees but WHY do you charge if only check the balance? Totally understand a higher fee if using others bank to withdraw but if you just check the balance when there is no techcom's ATM around then WHY DO YOU CHARGE THE FEE?,2,1
F@st Mobile,Too much trouble with expiring password policy! It's ridiculous that you can simply use 6-digit ATM PIN to reset your complex password policy!,1,1
F@st Mobile,The message warning about balance of account should contain received account information to track history clearly. Recently there is only the amount with note.,3,1
F@st Mobile,"Stop asking for changing password please. Let the users manage their password at their own risk. Not everyone has time to think of and remember a new password, ok? This is disturbing.",1,1
F@st Mobile,Font size should be larger. Compatible with Android 11 since the launch of Android 11.,5,1
F@st Mobile,I don't like having to change my password periodically. It takes a lot of time and becomes unnecessarily complicated,1,1
F@st Mobile,Cannot use 24/7 money transfer on the app,1,1
F@st Mobile,"After update android 12, the finger print is not working - error code: 101022 - plz fix it!",3,1

F@st Mobile,"Terrible UI/UX. I can't type my adress at all. It keeps saying "" letter number - / only """,1,1

F@st Mobile,"This app was working great.. Then suddenly.. Error.. Wrong password, fingerprint disabled.. Called techcombank.. Come to branch!! Rediculous.. There are better ways.

F@st Mobile,"I can't log in. It always crash or ""no connection"" (something like that). Please fix it",1,1
F@st Mobile,This app is great but I will be better if it has the QR code for making more convinient when someone gets user's account number. Thank you,3,1

SC Mobile Vietnam,"The app function poorly. It works and then it stop working. Sometimes it works smoothly, fast and all, but sometimes it's impossible to log in.",2,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,"Edited to raise this to five stars. They contacted me personally. And assured me they would fix it in the latest app update. And they did. Great customer service! ***** Great, now I can't take screenshots of my transactions when they're finished, and since this isn't a feature of your app like it is my other bank, now I have no way to take a picture that I just sent the transaction. Please either add an automatic screenshot feature, or re-enable being able to take a screenshot.",5,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,"Very poorly designed app. Often glitchy and displays error messages. Password can mysteriously stop working in app while still working on browser, customer service solution is to reset password. App developers seem unaware or uninterested in finding a solution.",1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,"I know you guys have to being worked very hard to improve this mtfk app. But, it too lag. Hanoi is raining right now and i cant open app to tranfer money to my account to book a taxi. The card got declined. You guys need to help me fix this. A lot of bugs, i don't want to being disappointed about this international bank app. Thanks.",2,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,"Worst app ever. Very big inconvenience when you are hurrying to pay and transfer money, then the app keeps loading and kicks you out then keeps loading and loading. Trash.",1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,I cannot log in and it happen very often!,1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,"What a stupid app, bad experience. I checked the account info, and it mentioned that there is a previous payment needs to be paid, even I actually paid it last month but the app have no update on the card details. If you dont remember or recheck, you may pay 2 times for the same period.",1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,"Biometric login simply doesn't work! I enable it, receive confirmation by text. And the next time I open the app it asks me to login to enable it, in options it's marked as disabled. Stupid bug which lasts for longer than 2 months now without any fix. Clearly the bank doesn't care about the the user experience.",1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,"Ever worst banking app!!!!! 1. I want to redeem my travel miles, the UI asked to check the box to redeem. I did, but after doing that, there's no confirmation about task completion!!! I can't know whether my order (redemption) is done or not??? 2. When navigate to previous screen, it always close the app and I have to re-login. Takes alot of time!!!",1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,"There are have a lot of defects. For instant, currently I created an transaction in order to transfer my money to a local bank account. However, It is over my balance and can be made a transaction. It should be covered inside the App. Further more, the currency is duplicated in the app after making a failed submission. Additionally, this app is not satified with usability for the user. I've already feedbacked to the Customer care. Please check!",1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,"The app has prevented me from logging in for a while eventhough I can still do it on the web. I deleted and reinstall the app to see if it was only because of the version. It still does not work and now I can't log in on any device cause it asks for the code from my mobile app, which got logged out after the reinstallation.",1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,There are so many bugs in their online system. Can't set up new money transfers because of a bug in the name field. Can't see my credit card balance because it is delayed by a month. I complained in person in the bank and showed them the bugs. Nothing has been improved. Absolutely terrible service.,1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,"The UI is ugly and terrible, also the Ux. If you press back button, you can not go back to the previous page. You have to select home page at the top corner, then navigate again. I cant believe now we are at 2021 nearly 2022. And we still have to suffer this bad UX app like this.",1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,"The bank is quite good as it is but the application is so bad. Cannot use fingersprint, bad performance, slow content loading, not friendly user interface. Hope it can be upgraded someday.",2,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,"This is pathetic for such an established bank. The app is literally a mobile wrapper, and yet run incredibly slowly, very prone to bugs, glitches and provide no alternative to signing in. Worse yet, when the app is unresponsive, signing in via website will require a prompt generated inside the mobile app, which was UNAVAILABLE in the first place.",1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,"Worst banking app ever! Really hard to navigate within the app. Whenever I try to go back to a previous screen, it always closes the app without asking me. Also, the loading speed is super slow!",1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,"Very terrible. Inconvenience for users 1. The app runs very slow. 2. Always in unstable status. 3. If the app has problem, there is no any alternative to log in via website. The logic of the app and security is very bad idea.",1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,"The most stupid app I have ever used. It shows that SC Vietnam doesn't care about their clients at all. After the update, I can't login for days, error messages show up constantly as always. Customer support does not exist, they don't bother to reply to negative reviews here, that says it all. Now you are forced to register SC Mobile Key if you want to continue to use the app, it's not convenient if you can only access your account from one and only device. Sorry I will change my bank.",1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,"Such a suck app. It took me an hour to login to the app and i still dont know how i could login. I had to try 2 times with the app, it said wrong credential, then had to login via web to reset the lock counter, then try the mobile app again. Could not recall how many times i repeated those steps. Now i cannot login to the web app because dont know how to generate 6 digit authentication code.",1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,"Not user friendly at all!!! The app constantly says ""unable to process request"" when I trying to transfer money, so what the point of downloading a mobile banking app :)?",1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,"This app is awful. I regret to make an account at this bank to use this stupid application. Considering all comments here, I think no one takes care user's feedbacks. However, I still give some feedback here: - The UI is extremely ugly, and it looks like made from the 1990s. - The UX is the joke. Example: you go to some sub-screen, then you cannot go back. If you go back by pressing Android's back button, they will close the app. - Super slow. You need to wait 10 seconds every time you open the app, then wait another 20 seconds just for login. I think the bank has dedicated this application to one dreadful outsource team. I recommend Standard Chartered Vietnam should switch to another team and build it again. This app cannot be saved. P/S: Many outsourced teams can deliver wonderful applications, please email me if you need one ;)",1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,Quite difficult to use and poor functionality.,1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,Very bad. App crash,1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,Terrible performance app. Some screens have no back button and when press android back button I am kicked out of the app. All the bad things seem like sc don't care about user's experience.,1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,"So now you have to login twice with unclear instruction, whoever thought of this system clearly didnt test it before rolling out. Please think things through and read the feedbacks. Nov 2019: App crash and can't start while online login force you to use app, are you joking? Nov 2020: Bug all the time, not from app then from card.",1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,"Difficult to use, slow logging in. Ledger balance and available balance are different for what? I just need to know the real time balance (not ledger balance!) and you don't show me that. The ledger balance is ridiculous to show!",1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,"Press Back and then kicked out and cannot sign in back again. Notification is ""service not avai temporarily..."". I call the care center, they said because my wifi is not good. But can wifi go bad whenever I press Back? Suffer this problem for too long. How can you guys claim yourself global standard with rubbish app like this???",1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,"Crashed all the time, uninstalled and re installed. But still crashed, so frustrated. Logged in on the web version, being asked to verify on the phone app 1st :).",1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,"Worst bank app ever. The UX/UI are both bad. Some tabs are even useless. Information updated so slow, I spent out a lot of money already but it still shows 0 DR. I cannot control or follow how much did I spent or else. This app even worse than VCB app or Vnpay and cannot be compared with Momo. If you are serious in e-banking at least use money on good development agencies.",1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,"Too bad, always crash when I put app in the background, then can not login again until I clear storage. You should check the simple error like this before you release app to end user. Too bad again!",1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,"Wow, a global standard Bank with this bugging banking app, can't connect, can't even login. How can I trust you with my money when your app is THIS GOOD?? great!",1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,"First time I open app, it asked ""đồng ý"" without showing up what it's requiring for. I guess this is a virus, not finance app. Everyone should not install it, you can be hacked. 🤣",1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,Lost session when resume,1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,"Troublesome to use, app keeps on loading on log in page for 5minutes and preventing user to log in. It was extremely inconvenient to use the mobile banking of SC before, now it makes users use mobile as token, the phone app prevents me from log in hence I cant log in to online banking website on pc as well!!!",1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,"Stupid app ever, user interface does not friendly, seems like it was copied from the web base into an app. Too compicated steps to transfer money. very poor",1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,"The app has crash continuously for 5 days without any information from the bank. I cannot do any transation, even via internet banking. Called to the hotline, they do not know when the app will be working again.",1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,Slowest bank app I've ever used. It couldn't even load the log in page. Extremely annoy experience. Not sure if you seriously want your customer using your bank app. 1 star,1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,"The system is getting worse and worse.. it asked for update but it cannot download the updates.. its been hours already, still buffering.. And why we cannot have screen shots anymore? You know that it is important as proof. You are so paranoid of your security that your system sucks already!!",1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,"Honestly, I am not able to vote 2 stars. My brain and heart have a same voice. This is the worst app I ever used.",1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,"The UI is very bad. It looks like a project of student in university. The service of bank is also not good at all. They said the hotline number is 24/7, but I called on Saturday morning and it's always busy",2,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,"Super slow, unfriendly interface. Absolutely useless while abroad. So you won't know how much money left and how much you spent.",1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,Too slow. Too complicated to use. Try to login many times today but it keeps loading. Then i'm late for the credit card due date and i have to pay for it 'coz of your issue???,1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,"The app keep asking me to upgrade even after I uninstalled and reinstalled the app. It's terrible that I cannot open the app now. Come on SC, it's a banking app. You need to be serious.",1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,App requires permission to make and manage phone calls. Can't use it if not allow. Why does it need to manage my phone calls???? Why????,2,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,"Very terrible app, even after upgrading new version. Slow app, stupid logic, inconvennient interface, poor service.",1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,"The app is poorly designed or greatly lack of testing. After loggeg in, there is no way to get rid of the info screen to really use the app unless agree to the sign up SC ....",2,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,"Can't login on Android 6. My account can login in other device which use Android OS version higher than 6. I try with other device also use Android 6 and other Standard account, the issue also happened Please confirm app can run well on Android 6 or not ?",2,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,"I wish it allows me to rate -1 star. - Can't use fingerprint - Very poor navigation in the app. The Back button on Android is useless (unless you want to double tap to quit the app) - Content loading is very slow on every single page - All the links (Find ATM, Help, Contact us...) on the login menu didn't work. It just opens Chrome (nice, thanks) And after all of these feedback, the app was never get updated since last 1.5year.",1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,"Very bad app. Slow and buggy. It takes minutes to login, when logged in it shows nothing in my account.",1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,"This is one of the apps that has the worst user experience I have ever seen in my life. And worst of all, users are forced to use this useless app that CAN'T MAKE a SINGLE DECENT transaction.",1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,"Bad app, the amount doesn't have seperate character. 4 steps to transfer and input Acc No. doesn't have Acc Name. Transfer after 3PM have to wait until 9AM next day.",1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,Too bad... asked user to upgrade and then could not be upgraded and could not use. How come you claimed you are an international bank with the app like this!,1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,Terrible app. Crashes more than it works. I think this by design because I can't withdraw/transfer money without this app. Leave SCB! They are hopeless.,1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,"Invite and ask me many times to open the credit card. After i open and spend more than 4 mil just to get the speaker. And the speaker never comes. Slow app and always bug, wth.",1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,"The app is too slow and lag, no search for list so one has to scroll to look for items. Bad app.",1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,It sucks. Crashed very frequently. I couldn't open the app or transfer money when needed. I'll move my money to other banks.,1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,An unbelievably terrible app. I couldn't even log in to my account in the very first try let alone doing anything with it. This is unacceptable for a banking app. The devs who are responsible for this app should really consider looking for new jobs. I wish I could give this app 0.2 star.,1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,Retard UX - Tedios process: long opening time -> click on login ->wait for loading -> click on finger print -> click on ad banner => all have long loading time. Previously: finger print option showed up upon opening app,1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,It takes forever and multiple tries just to log in. Forces user to use SC Mobile Key while that function is completely inconvenient and complicating.,1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,The app forced me to upgrade when I needed to use it the most. It didn't allow me to ignore the upgrade prompt to login.,1,1
SC Mobile Vietnam,Worst banking app ever . Can't believe it's standard chartered banks official app. Crashes several times and later doesn't even accept password,1,1
